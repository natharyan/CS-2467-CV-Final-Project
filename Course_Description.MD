### Overview

This course introduces the basics of computer vision:
- The mechanics of images
- Core problems in the field
- Tools and techniques developed to address these challenges

#### Topics Covered (Tentative)
1. **Image Formation:**
   - Geometric and Photometric principles
2. **Pixel Grouping:**
   - Grouping pixels into objects
3. **Feature Detection:**
   - Edge, Corner, and Blob detectors for matching
4. **Reconstruction:**
   - 3D and Multi-view geometry
5. **Recognition:**
   - Classification and Detection

**Deep Learning applications** for computer vision will also be covered, with a brief introduction to the foundational concepts of deep learning.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
1. Gain a thorough understanding of:
   - **Image Formation** (Geometric and Photometric)
   - **Perspective Projection**
   - **Camera Mechanics** (Calibration, Color, Light, and Shading)
   - **Homogeneous Coordinates**

2. Develop skills in:
   - Identifying and extracting **features** (e.g., LMS, RANSAC, Hough Transform)
   - Creating and using **feature descriptors and matching**
   - Applying **Homography** for transformations
   - Understanding **Stereo and Epipolar Geometry**
   - Solving 3D problems like SLAM and Bundle Adjustment

3. Understand and apply deep learning techniques to:
   - 2D problems (Object detection, Semantic segmentation)
   - 3D problems (Reconstruction, Depth estimation)

### Requirements (Reading List and Other Materials)
The course will involve the following components:
- **Exams/Quizzes:** Regular assessments to test understanding.
- **Assignments:** Four assignments focusing on key concepts.
- **Project:** A major component with nearly equal weightage to other evaluations. A first version of the project proposal is due during the midterm break, and the final project must align closely with the approved proposal.
- **Labs:** Hands-on sessions to reinforce theoretical concepts.

### Grading Rubric
- **Midterm:** 15%
- **Final Exam:** 20%
- **Quizzes:** 10%
- **Assignments (4):** 30%
- **Project:** 25%
